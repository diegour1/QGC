Density Matrix Variational Quantum Classifier Python library

## Installation

As the repo is in private mode, to install the library is necessary to [generate a personal token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-personal-access-token-classic) (less than 1 min) and use it as authentication for the installation as follows:

<pre>
!pip install --upgrade --quiet git+https://<b>[personal-token-kere]</b>@github.com/diegour1/DMVQC.git
</pre>

Paste your personal token in the input box that appears after running the next cell and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. it will automatically install the package.


## About the documentation

Documentation is automatically generated by Sphinx. To compile the documentation, change directory to `DMVQC/docs` and run the following commands:

- `sphinx-apidoc -o ./source ../src` to build documentation files from docstrings. `src` will be the codebase source folder for the library. See the style [here](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/napoleon.html).
- `make html` to compile documentation to HTML.
